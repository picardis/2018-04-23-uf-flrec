    <li><b>A spreadsheet program</b>
      <br>For this workshop you will need a spreadsheet program. LibreOffice comes
      preinstalled with several Linux distributions. If you don't already have it, use
      your package manager to install it: (e.g., <code>sudo apt-get install
	libreoffice</code> for Ubuntu and other Debian-based distributions).
</ul>

<p>

  <li><b>R</b>
    <br>In the workshop, we will use RStudio. RStudio is a nice interface to the
    programming language R. To use RStudio, you need to install both R and RStudio.
    <ul>
      <li>Follow the instructions for your distribution
	from <a href="https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/">CRAN</a>. For most distributions, you
	can use your package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run <code>sudo
	apt-get install r-base</code>, and for Fedora run <code>sudo yum install
	R</code>) but make sure that you have at least R 3.2.2 (as pre-packaged
	versions might be out of date).
      <li>To install RStudio, go to
	the <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop">RStudio Download
	  page</a>
      <li>Under <i>Installers</i> select the version for your distribution.
      <li>Once it's downloaded, double click the file to install it (or <code>sudo dpkg
	  -i rstudio-x.yy.zzz-amd64.deb</code> at the terminal).
      <li>Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any error messages.
    </ul>

<p>

  <li><b>SQLite</b>
    <br>
    For this workshop we're going to use the <a href="http://sqlitebrowser.org/">DB Browser for SQLite</a>. 
    <ul>
      <li>To install the DB Browser, type the following commands in your terminal:
	     <li> sudo apt-get update 
	     <li> sudo apt-get install sqlitebrowser
    </ul>
</ol>
