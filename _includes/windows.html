<li><b>A spreadsheet program</b>
<br>For this workshop you will need a spreadsheet program. Many people already have
Microsoft Excel installed, and if you do, you're set!
<br>
If you need a spreadsheet
program, there are a few other options, like OpenOffice and LibreOffice. Install
instructions for LibreOffice, which is free and open source, are here.
       <ul>
          <li><b>Download the Installer</b>
        <br>Install LibreOffice by going to the <a href=https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/>installation page</a>. The version for Windows
should automatically be selected. Click on the button below "Main Installer" <b>Download Version x.y.z</b>. You
will go to a page that asks about a donation, but you don't need to make one.
Your download should begin automatically.
          <li><b>Install LibreOffice</b>
            <br>Once the installer is downloaded, double click on it and it should install.
